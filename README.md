# Resume Builder
This program is to allow one to more easily create and adjust their resume for various job opportunities. Say that you are eyeing a few jobs that have different specifications. Instead of having to go to Word and change your resume, export, submit, and redo this process, you can store everything that you could possibly want in a JSON file and, upon running the script, select the specific information that you want to give and have it be filled in a template.
